# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the systematic identification, tracking, and resolution of failing unit tests in the ModbusSimulator project. The goal is to ensure all unit tests pass while maintaining code quality and test integrity through a structured approach.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This testing and bug fixing initiative supports the overall product quality goals by ensuring:
- Reliable and robust codebase through comprehensive testing
- Early detection and resolution of issues
- Maintenance of high code quality standards
- Systematic approach to technical debt resolution

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically identify and fix failing unit tests, so that the codebase maintains high quality and reliability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN the system SHALL identify all failing tests with detailed error information
2. IF a test fails THEN the system SHALL record the specific error message, stack trace, and affected test method
3. WHEN fixing a test THEN the system SHALL verify the fix by re-running the specific test

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track the progress of test fixes, so that I can monitor completion status and ensure no issues are overlooked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a failing test is identified THEN the system SHALL create a task to track its resolution
2. IF a test fix is completed THEN the system SHALL mark the task as completed and verify the fix
3. WHEN all test fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL run a full test suite to ensure no regressions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix test assertion issues, so that tests accurately reflect the expected behavior of the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test expects `CreatedResult` but receives `CreatedAtActionResult` THEN the system SHALL update the test assertion to match the actual controller behavior
2. IF the controller behavior is correct THEN the system SHALL update the test expectations accordingly
3. WHEN updating test assertions THEN the system SHALL ensure the change aligns with the intended API behavior

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Test Integrity**: Maintain the original intent of each test while fixing assertion issues
- **Consistent Testing Patterns**: Ensure all similar controller actions use consistent return types
- **Clear Test Documentation**: Each test should clearly indicate what behavior it's verifying

### Performance
- Test execution should complete within reasonable time limits (< 5 seconds per test suite)
- Batch testing approach to avoid resource exhaustion

### Reliability
- All tests must pass consistently across multiple runs
- Fixed tests should not introduce new failures in other tests
- Maintain backward compatibility of API responses

### Usability
- Clear error reporting for failing tests
- Systematic tracking of fix progress
- Easy identification of remaining issues
